"""Backend-importable prebuilt helpers.

The installers reuse install_llama_prebuilt.py directly; this package holds the
backend-side shapes the studio/ scripts cannot provide (the backend runs with
studio/spartan_backend as its sys.path root): runtime_libs (wheel CUDA dirs), child_env
(secret scrubbing + WSL ROCm dirs), freshness_flow and update_flow (the shared
mechanics behind the *_cpp_freshness / *_cpp_update twins).
